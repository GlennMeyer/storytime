	The Mailman barely made it to the front door. When the door opened, Mrs. Pennington said, "hello", but before she had a real chance to say "thank you", the mail blew out of the mailman's hands into the house and the front doo slammed in his face. Mrs. Pennington rand to pick up the mail.

	"Oh my," she said.

[16] "There", she said, "it will be safe until we get home."
		
	Tommy smiled, ran to the car and got in. He rolled down the back indow and looked up into the sky. He wondered where the old leaf had gone. Perhaps one day he would see what the old leaf had seen. Perhaps.

[3]Tommy crawled down from the window-seat and ran to the door.  He opened it with a bang.  The wind blew fiercely and snatched the newly recovered mail from Mrs. Pennington's hands and blew it even further into the house.

"Oh my," she said again.  Tommy ran outside and the door slammed shut.

Outside, yellow, gold, and red leaves were leaping from swaying trees, landing on the roof, jumping off the roof, and then chasing one another down the street in tiny whirlwinds of merriment.

[?] The wind blew Tommy and the maple leaf along.  Tommy thought of his choices.  He wanted to continue to play.

"Okay," Tommy said, "I will go with you to the dump."

The winds shifted and Tommy and the leaf were blown in the direction of the city dump.

The old leaf didn't follow.  He was blown further down the block and suddenly lifted up high into the air.

[?] "Not so fast," she said getting out of the car.  "You are not allowed play in there.  Don't you see the smoke?"

Tommy watched the maple leaf blow against the wall and struggle to get over.  He ran over to  get it but was unable to reach it.

Mrs. Pennington walked over and took the leaf.  She put it in her pocket.

[8] The maple leaf blew in front of him.  It was bright red with well-defined veins.  The sun-light shone through it giving it a brilliance never before seen by a little boy's eyes.

[?] A maple leaf came close-by, touched him and moved ahead.  Tommy met him shortly, brushed against him, and moved further ahead.  They swirled around and around, hit cars and poles, flew up into the air and then down again.

"This is fun," Tommy thought.

[?]Tommy was watching the shutters open and then shut, open and then shut.

"Mom," he said, "may I go outside?"

"Be careful," she said.  "It's so windy today."

[?]"Hey," he called out, "the sights up here.  They are spectacular.  Come and see."

Tommy and the maple leaf ignore him.

"I see something.  I see the dump."  The old leaf cried out.  "I see smoke.  Come up here.  I see fire."

"I see nothing," the maple leaf said.

[?]However, the was no Tommy in the front yard.

"Tommy?"

Tommy was a leaf.  He was blowing down the street with the rest of his play-mates.
