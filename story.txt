[?] However, there was no Tommy in the front yard.

"Tommy?"

Tommy was a leaf. He was blowing down the street with the rest of his play-mates.

[?] "Hey," he called out, "the sights up here. They are spectacular. Come and see."

  Tommy and the maple leaf ignored him. 

  "I see something. I see the dump." The old leaf cried out. "I see smoke.
  Come up here. I see fire"

  "I see nothing, " the maple leaf said. 

  [?]Tommy was watching the shutters open and then shut, open and then shut.

  "Mom," he said, "may I go outside?"

  "Be careful," she said. "It's so windy today."
